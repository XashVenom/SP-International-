# SP International Pvt Ltd — website

Static brochure site for **SP International Pvt Ltd** (motto: *Trade Beyond Borders*).

Preferred public domain: **spinternationalpvtltd.com**
A `CNAME` file is included for GitHub Pages. DNS must still be pointed at GitHub Pages by the domain owner — this file does not mean that step is already done.

## Open locally

From this folder:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://localhost:8080

You can also open `index.html` directly in a browser. The quote form drafts a mailto message and does not need a backend.

## GitHub Pages (XashVenom/SP-International-)

1. Put the contents of this folder at the **root** of https://github.com/XashVenom/SP-International- on the default branch (`main`).
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages**.
3. Source: **Deploy from a branch** → `main` → `/ (root)` → Save.
4. After the first deploy, the site is served from GitHub Pages on that repository.
5. Custom domain: in Pages, enter `spinternationalpvtltd.com`. The `CNAME` file in this folder matches that name. Point the domain DNS at GitHub Pages when you are ready; do not assume it is already live.

No build step. No cart. No server-side form handler.
